## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **API Changes**: Anthropic may update their API
   - *Mitigation*: Implement adapter pattern for API client

2. **Response Quality**: Generated content may vary in quality

3. **Performance Issues**: Large specifications may be slow to process
   - *Mitigation*: Implement background processing and pagination

4. **Security Concerns**: API keys need protection
   - *Mitigation*: Secure storage and encryption for credentials

## Maintenance Plan

### Ongoing Activities
- Monthly prompt template updates
- Quarterly review of API usage and costs
- Continuous improvement of validation rules
- Regular backups of specification library

### Version Updates

// Example of prerequisite relationship structure

  // Hard prerequisites (must be completed)
  "hard": [
    {
      sourceTaskId: "T007", // First Coat Application

## Important Notes

> **⚠️ DO NOT START IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL EXPLICITLY INITIATED ⚠️**
> 
> This implementation plan is based on the application's state as of March 2025. When implementation begins, this plan MUST be reevaluated based on:
> 1. The current state of the application at that time
> 2. Changes in technology landscape and best practices
> 3. Additional features and requirements that may have been added
> 4. Current project structure and architecture
>
> Consider this document as conceptual guidance rather than a rigid implementation plan.

## Enhanced Prompt Template Structure

To support the structured data needed for the SOP Generator, the Anthropic API prompt template should include sections for:

```
[Your existing prompt content]

Additionally, please include the following structured data sections at the end of the specification:

## METADATA (JSON)
{
  "paintableItem": "[ITEM_NAME]",
  "substrate": "[SUBSTRATE_TYPE]",
  "projectType": "[PROJECT_TYPE]",
  "unitOfMeasure": "[UNIT]",
  "complexityLevels": {
    "low": 0.8,
    "medium": 1.0,
    "high": 1.2
  }
}

## TASK_PREREQUISITES (JSON)
{
  "taskSequence": ["T001", "T002", "T003"...],
  "conditionalPrerequisites": [
    {
      "taskId": "T003",
      "conditions": [
        {"type": "substrate_condition", "value": "damaged"}
      ],
      "prerequisiteType": "hard"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

## SUBSTRATE_VARIATIONS (JSON)
{
  "vinyl": {
    "requiredTasks": ["T001", "T002", "T007"],
    "optionalTasks": ["OPT01"]
  },
  "wood": {
    "requiredTasks": ["T001", "T002", "T003", "T004", "T005"],
    "optionalTasks": ["OPT01", "OPT02"]
  },
  ...
}
```

This structured data will be parsed by the SOP Generator to create the appropriate relationships and variations in the system.
